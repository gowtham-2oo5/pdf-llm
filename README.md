# Chat with PDF using Gemini

This Streamlit app allows you to interact with PDF documents by asking questions in any styleâ€”whether in layman's terms or technical language. It uses LangChain and Google Generative AI (Gemini) to process the PDFs, extract relevant information, and provide detailed responses based on the content within the documents.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload multiple PDF files and extract text, including tables and sections.
- **Text Chunking**: Split extracted text into manageable chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Store Creation**: Create a local FAISS vector store from the text chunks for efficient similarity search.
- **Question Answering**: Ask questions in any format and receive detailed, context-aware responses using Google Generative AI (Gemini).
- **Flexible Response Style**: The model adapts its response style based on the input, handling both layman and technical language.
